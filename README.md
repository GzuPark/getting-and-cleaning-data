# Getting and Cleaning Data
Jongmin Park

### Overview
This project is a final assignment to Getting and Cleaning Data by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. The data which I work on from [The UCI Machine Learning Repository] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and [the data for this project can download here] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

### How to work
If you see the source data, all of them are '.txt' files. I worked on R environment, so you can refer 'run_analysis.R' file which I upload in the same repo. You have to modify line 19 on run_analysis.R depends on your path which you saved and unzipped the source data.
